#Overview
The player controls a platform which can move left and right. The goal is to destroy all
blocks by deflecting the ball with the platform.
#Player
The player can move a platform using left and right arrow keyboard buttons. Initially the
player can choose the angle of the ball by pressing the left mouse button (the ball should be
launched in the direction of the mouse cursor).
#Ball 
The ball moves linearly and reflects from edges, blocks and the
player's platform.
#Environment
The level consists of blocks, which could be destroyed by a single hit. The ball should
reflect from blocks after their destruction.
#Win/loss conditions
The player loses when the ball is not caught by the platform. Victory can be achieved by
destroying all blocks and catching the ball with the platform after.
The game should be restarted after victory/loss.
